Personal IRC bot written in mSL (mIRC Scripting Language)

Spanish IRC Bot created by myself on 2004.
It manages channels on IRC, you can be the master.
Bot has a lot of things (now in 2022 im sure most of them dont work) feel free to update and use it.

Bot has some weapons inside it.

Google search, tcp scan port, email sender, sms bomber, a lot of features for managing channels on IRC.

Just make sure you read all files and understand the commands,
There's few levels of master,

root (max level)
master (reduced commands)

it also has a lot of funny junk for irc, like channel floods, "dcc bugs for mirc version 5"

Use at your own risk
